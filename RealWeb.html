        <h3>Hello Welcome to the Southern Europe Mythologies</h3>
        <p>According to the Greek creation myth, at first there was only Chaos, which was basically nothingness. 
          Eventually, Gaia emerges out of the void along with some other beings. 
          She gives birth to Uranus and the two form a union which creates the twelve Titans. 
          Twelve is also the number of the Olympic gods, such as Zeus, Poseidon, Hades and others, 
          each of them responsible for a certain element, like the sea, thunder, fire. 
          Each of them has their own myths that enrich the world even more. 
          There is also Heracles and his tasks. 
          Some of my personal favourite myths include Hades and Persephone, Medusa and Ariadne. 
          Overall, there is a reason why Greek lore is such a staple in the Western culture â€“ their relationships, 
          personalities and havoc they cause are captivating to read about.

          <!-- In accordance to the greek creation myth, in the beginning there was only chaos or in other words the world in empty.
          After so many eons, gaia finally emerges along with some other gods. She also gave birth to uranus and the two of them created the twelve titans -->
